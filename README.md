# Python
I am revisiting python and hoping to cover everything from the basics. This repository will therefore be a collection of all the programs that I practise from the very basic ones to the most advanced ones (if I try them :/! I will, I will!). Its been long since I was introduced to Python programming language. I wasn't very enthusiastic about maintaining a github repository back then to keep a record of all that was learnt. So, today, I begin documenting my Python revision journey. <br\>
If you are here as a beginner, we are in the same boat. And if you are here as a expert, please correct my code! <br\>
My main objective with revisiting the concepts is to employ the knowledge of different complexities that I learnt back in college. Let's see how much I can get done. See you in the different sections of this repository.
